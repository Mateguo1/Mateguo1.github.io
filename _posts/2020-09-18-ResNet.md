# ResNet

When the tranditional network is too deep, gradient explosion, disappearance and degradation may occur.Here are two highlights of the **ResNet**, which are also the main content of this article:

1) The Residual structure is proposed to make it possible to build ultra deep network structure, which can solve the degradation problem.

2) Using Batch Normalization to accelerate training, which can solve the problem of vanishing / exploding gradients.

They are as follows:

## Residual：

#### 1. Overall structure:

The residual structure on the left in the figure below is applicable to the network with fewer layers such as ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, and the right is applicable to the network with more layers such as ResNet-101 and ResNet-152.

As for why the deep network uses the Residual structure on the right, simply caculate the number of parameters of the two and you must all ensure the same output: 

left：3×3×256×256+3×3×256×256=1,179,648<br>right：1×1×256×64+3×3×64×64+1×1×64×256=69,632<br>It's obvious thah the number of parameters of the right one is less than the left one.

Then I will explain the meaing of each part of the Residul structure. First **the straight line part** is a series of operation such as normal convolution, and **the curve part** is the shortcut branch, and finally add the output of the straight line part and the shortcut branch, and don't forget to ensure the shape of the two output characteristic matrices is the same.

The following figure shows the overall structure of ResNet-34:

#### 2. Detailed explanation of left structure:

It can be seen that the curve part of the Residual block in the overall structure diagram above can be divided into**<font color = "red" > solid line </font>**and**<font color = "red" > dotted line </font>**.Next we will talk about it in detail.

##### (1) solid line：

The Stride of convolution is 1, which ensures that the overall shape is invariant.

##### (2) dotted line：

The Residual structure of the dotted line is to reduce the dimension, and the stride of the first convolution of the straight line is 2, the rest are 1, and the stride of the convolution of the curve part is 2, so as to ensure the same output shape of them. 

#### 3.  Detailed explanation of right structure:

The difference between a solid line and a dotted line is basically the same as above. Pay attention to the convonlution in which the Stride changes.Then others are explained as follows:

conv1：It can be seen that is 1×1, and the channel dimension is different from the input, which is used to compress the channel.<br>
conv2：Normal convolution 3×3<br>
conv3：As you can see, it's also 1×1 which is used to restore the channel in order to ensure the same dimension as the shortcut output.

#### 4. summary and attention:

The image below shows the configuration of ResNet with different depths given in the original paper, the ×N means that the Residual structure is repeated N times:

![image-20200724201909926](/assets/img/image-20200724201909926.png)

And pay attention to all the conv3_x, conv4_x, conv5_x, the first layer of them  is the dotted line which is to adjust the shape.The width and height of the output character matirx are half of the input, and then the channel is adjusted to the channel required by the next layer.

But fot ResNet-50/101/152, the conv2_x corresponds to the first layer of the Residual which is also a dlotted line, because it's necessary to adjust the channerl of the input charateristic matrix. Through the table, it's known that the output feature map after 3×3 Max pooling is  [56,56,64], but the input feature map that conv2_x expects is [56,56,256]. Here we still want to ensure that the output of straight line and curve line is same, but we only need to adjust the channel here, and there is no need to adjust the width and height as above.
